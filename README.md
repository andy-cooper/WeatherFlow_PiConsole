# WeatherFlow PiConsole
Raspberry Pi Python console for the Weather Flow Smart Home Weather Station. The 
console uses the WeatherFlow REST API and websocket to stream data from your 
Weather Flow Smart Home Weather Station in real time via the internet. As soon 
as the data from your station reaches the WeatherFlow servers, it is pushed 
immediately to the console, including the 3-second rapid fire wind updates.   

Many of the graphical elements in the console are based on the Weather34 Home
Weather Station Template (https://www.weather34.com/homeweatherstation/)

## Update Instructions

Follow these instructions to update an existing installation of the WeatherFlow 
PiConsole. These instructions assume you have installed the PiConsole in the 
default directory (~/wfpiconsole/). If you have installed the PiConsole in a 
different location, I assume you know what you are doing! The update process 
will delete all files associated with the currently installed version except the 
.ini file, and will then download and install the updated version in its place.

```
cd ~/wfpiconsole/
rm -rf !("wfpiconsole.ini")
wget https://api.github.com/repos/peted-davis/WeatherFlow_PiConsole/tarball -O wfpiconsole.tar.gz
tar -xvf wfpiconsole.tar.gz --strip 1
rm wfpiconsole.tar.gz
python3 main.py
```

If you are have the console setup to auto run using the .service file, copy the
new .service file into /etc/systemd/system and renable:

```
sudo cp wfpiconsole.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable wfpiconsole.service
```

## Auto-Run Instructions

If you want to enable the console to auto-run when the Raspberry Pi powers up, 
copy the wfpiconsole.service file into /etc/systemd/system/. This .service file 
assumes you have installed the PiConsole in the default directory 
(~/wfpiconsole/) and are using the default 'Pi' username. If you have installed 
the PiConsole in a different location, or are using a different username, I 
assume you know what you are doing and can edit the .service file appropriately. 

```
cd ~/wfpiconsole/
sudo cp wfpiconsole.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

Start the service using

```
sudo systemctl start wfpiconsole.service
```

If the console boots and everything is working, stop the console and set the 
service to start automatically at reboot

```
sudo systemctl stop wfpiconsole.service
sudo systemctl enable wfpiconsole.service
```

Reboot your Raspberry Pi and the console should come up automatically

```
sudo reboot now
```

If you are going to use the auto-start method, it is highly recommended that you 
can SSH into your Raspberry Pi, as the console can only be stopped using the 
stop command above and not ctrl-c on the keyboard.

## Installation Instructions

Follow these instructions to setup a new installation of the WeatherFlow 
PiConsole on your Raspberry Pi Official 7 inch touch screen. This initial 
installation should take ~1 hour.

The instructions assume you have already sucesfully setup your Raspberry Pi and 
installed Raspbian Stretch with Desktop, have attached the touch screen, and 
have either a keyboard and mouse attached directly to the Pi, or you can access 
the Pi through SSH/VNC. If you are starting from scratch, some of these links 
may help get you started:

* https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
* https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/security.md
* https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/
* https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc/

### Step 1: Make sure your Raspberry Pi is fully up to date

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

### Step 2: Upgrade the Python 3 version of Pip

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```	

### Step 3: Confirm current user is in "input" and "video" groups

```
sudo usermod -a -G input,video $(whoami)
```

### Step 4: Install required dependencies

`sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev pkg-config libgl1-mesa-dev libgles2-mesa-dev python-setuptools libgstreamer1.0-dev git-core gstreamer1.0-plugins-{bad,base,good,ugly} gstreamer1.0-{omx,alsa} python-dev libmtdev-dev xclip xsel libatlas-base-dev`

```
y (confirms you want to install dependencies)
[press enter]
```

### Step 5: Install required Python modules

```
sudo python3 -m pip install autobahn[twisted] pytz pyasn1-modules service_identity geopy ephem Cython numpy packaging
```

### Step 6: Install Kivy Python library - this make take some time

```
sudo python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/kivy/kivy.git@master
```

### Step 7: Configure Kivy for Raspberry Pi touchscreen

Run Kivy for the first time to generate configuration files:

```
python3 -c "import kivy"
```

Open file ".Kivy/config.ini" in Nano:

```
nano ~/.kivy/config.ini
```

Delete everything in the [input] section. Add this:

```
mouse = mouse
mtdev_%(name)s = probesysfs,provider=mtdev
hid_%(name)s = probesysfs,provider=hidinput
```	

Save changes in Nano:

```
ctrl-x
y (confirms you want to save changes)
[press enter]
```

Reboot the system:

```
sudo reboot now
```

### Step 8: Download WeatherFlow PiConsole source code

```
cd && mkdir wfpiconsole && cd wfpiconsole
wget https://api.github.com/repos/peted-davis/WeatherFlow_PiConsole/tarball -O PiConsole.tar.gz
tar -xvf PiConsole.tar.gz --strip 1
rm PiConsole.tar.gz
```

### Step 9: Configure and Run WeatherFlow PiConsole

To get the WeatherFlow PiConsole up and running, you need to register for a 
number of API keys. One API key is needed determine the the station location 
(country) from its latitude/longitude, one needed to download an apppropriate 
weather forecast, and one needed to download the closest METAR information to 
your station location.  

First, go to http://www.geonames.org/login and register for a new account. Once
you have registered, go to your account (http://www.geonames.org/manageaccount)
and activate "Free Web Services". Once this is done, your username will be your
'GeoNames' API key.

Next, if you live in the UK go to the UK MetOffice DataPoint homepage
(https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/datapoint), and register for a new account. You'll
be given an API key that will be you 'MetOffice' API key.

If you live outside the UK, register instead for a DarkSky API account 
(https://darksky.net/dev/register). This will be your 'DarkSky' API key. The 
console requires you to enter either a MetOffice API key or a DarkSky API key.

Finally go to CheckWX Aviation Weather and register to enable access to the 
closest METAR information to you station location. 
(https://www.checkwx.com/signup). This will be your 'CheckWX' key.

Once you have registered for the required API keys, go ahead and run the console
for the first time using:

```
python3 main.py
```

As this is the first run, you'll be asked to enter the API keys you have just
signed-up for above, as well as information about your station. This includes 
your station ID and device ID for your outdoor Air and Sky modules. To find this 
information either open the WeatherFlow app or view your station page in a web
browser. Click on the gear icon -> Stations -> [Station name] -> Status.

If you want to integrate with an Ecobee thermostat such as the Ecobee 4, enter "y"
at the prompt that asks you *Please enter your Use Ecobee Thermostat Data (required)*.
Follow the instructions to add an appliction to your Ecobee Thermostat, and then
press ENTER as instructed.

If you do not want to integrate with an Ecobee Thermostat, then simply answer "n"
at the prompt, press ENTER and continue as before. 

If all goes smoothly the console should automatically add the extra information 
it needs to your configuration file and then start running.

Congratulations, you have installed the Raspberry Pi Python console for the 
Weather Flow Smart Home Weather Station.
